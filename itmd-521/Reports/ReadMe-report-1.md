### Short summary and conclusion
In this meeting, we learned how to explore Chicago government data through the Chicago Data Portal. We were introduced to the portal, its platform Socrata, and walked through projects using open data.
The *data.cityofchicago.org* privides access to open data in JSON format. For example, https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/ktn3-fjzw.json provides open source public data about crimes in chicago
