### Observations and comments about the subject.

In my opinion, it was a unique event because the speaker tried to explain security in a different aspect.
The point that I learned in this event was that even if we create every smart technologies oriented in a perfect way, still there are a lot of weaknesses if we don't attention to social engineering and educating the people who work with the technologies. 

In other words, the hackers can penetrate to strong secure systems easily with the help of social engineering techniques. 

Therefore, when experts create one smart technology-based product perfectly, they must make sure that they train the users of that product perfectly too in order to prevent social engineering attacks.
